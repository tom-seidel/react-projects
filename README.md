**A growing collection of simple and creative React apps.**  
This repo is my React playground – focused on clarity, functionality, and clean state management.  
Each app is kept as simple as possible: no complex setups, no unnecessary dependencies – just React and pure learning.

## 🧱 Structure

Each subfolder contains an independent React project built with Create React App:
```
react-projects/
├── hello-react/
├── project-01/
├── project-02/
├── project-03/
├── .../
└── README.md
```
No extra complexity. No hidden layers. Just pure React building blocks – ready to explore and expand. ✨

## 💡 Why this Repo?

> I believe that building small, functional apps is the best way to master React.  
> This repository is made for everyone who wants to learn React by doing – without overwhelming complexity or endless boilerplate.

## 🔥 Goals

- ✅ Learn and practice React fundamentals (hooks, props, component structure)  
- 🧱 Build a collection of reusable mini apps  
- 🧠 Understand state, effects, and component design deeply  
- 🌍 Inspire others with simple and clear examples  
- 🛠️ Set the foundation for more advanced React projects

## 📈 Personal Goals

I use this repository as part of my commitment to grow steadily as a developer – and to document my React learning journey in an open and practical way.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add TypeScript versions of selected projects  
- Implement basic testing with Jest and React Testing Library  
- Explore context management (React Context API)  
- Create advanced mini apps like a chat app, a notes app, or a finance tracker  
- Deploy selected apps as live demos
